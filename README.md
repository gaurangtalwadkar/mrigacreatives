# MriGa Creatives Website

A premium, responsive developer portfolio website for MriGa Creatives.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- `style.css`: All styling (Dark mode, animations, glassmorphism).
- `script.js`: Scroll animations and header behavior.
- `assets/`: Contains images and icons.

## How to Run Locally

You can simply open `index.html` in your browser.

For a better experience (hot reloading), you can run a local server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## How to Host for Free

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1.  Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/new) (e.g., `mriga-creatives-site`).
2.  Upload all these files to the repository.
3.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and click **Save**.
5.  Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/mriga-creatives-site/`.

### Option 2: Netlify / Vercel

1.  Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup).
2.  Drag and drop this entire project folder into their dashboard.
3.  They will instantly deploy it and give you a free URL (e.g., `mriga-creatives.netlify.app`).

## Customization

-   **Colors**: Edit the variables in roughly line 1-15 of `style.css` to change the theme.
-   **Content**: Edit `index.html` to update text and links.
